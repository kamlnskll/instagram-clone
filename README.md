# instagram-clone

(WIP) Full stack Instagram web clone built using MongoDB, Express, React and Node (MERN stack) as well as Typescript.
If you'd like to try out the application yourself, I have left template .env files in the repository. 

You will need your own Cloudinary and MongoDB account for the backend (sign up for free). 

Stay tuned for repo updates as I continue to work on this! Cheers.
